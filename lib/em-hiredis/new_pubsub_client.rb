  # - :connected - on successful connection or reconnection
  # - :reconnected - on successful reconnection
  # - :disconnected - no longer connected, when previously in connected state
  # - :reconnect_failed(failure_number) - a reconnect attempt failed
  #     This event is passed number of failures so far (1,2,3...)
  # - :failed - on failing the final reconnect attempt
  #
  # Subscription events:
  # - :message(channel, message) - on receiving message on channel which has an active subscription
  # - :pmessage(pattern, channel, message) - on receiving message on channel which has an active subscription due to pattern
  # - :subscribe(channel) - on confirmation of subscription to channel
  # - :psubscribe(pattern) - on confirmation of subscription to pattern
  # - :unsubscribe(channel) - on confirmation of unsubscription from channel
  # - :punsubscribe(pattern) - on confirmation of unsubscription from pattern
  #
  # Note that :subscribe and :psubscribe will be emitted after a reconnection for
  # all subscriptions which were active at the time the connection was lost.
